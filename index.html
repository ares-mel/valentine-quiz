                    <p><span class="ln">1</span>People in many different countries celebrate Valentine's Day. Each year
                        <span class="ln">2</span>on February 14, friends and lovers exchange candy, flowers, love notes
                        <span class="ln">3</span>and greeting cards. These gifts are used as special messages of
                        friendship <span class="ln">4</span>and love. This tradition, as we know it today, has grown
                        from two basic <span class="ln">5</span><em>roots</em>: the Roman festival of Lupercalia and the
                        sad story of a Christian <span class="ln">6</span>doctor named Valentine.</p>

                    <p><span class="ln">7</span>Many years ago, the Romans celebrated the festival of Lupercalia on
                        <span class="ln">8</span>February 15. At first, the festival honoured the Roman god Lupercus,
                        <span class="ln">9</span>keeper of the crops and farm animals. However, as time passed, the
                        <span class="ln">10</span>Romans began to honour a different god during the festival. Her name
                        was <span class="ln">11</span>Juno, queen of the Roman gods and guardian of women and marriage.
                        At <span class="ln">12</span>the festival, all unmarried people played a special game. All the
                        females <span class="ln">13</span>wrote their names on pieces of paper and dropped <em>them</em>
                        into a big jar. <span class="ln">14</span>Then, all the males drew names from the jar and spent
                        the festival dancing <span class="ln">15</span>with the person whose name they had selected.</p>

                    <p><span class="ln">16</span>Celebrations of fun and love are still a part of today's Valentine
                        <span class="ln">17</span>tradition. More than 2,000 years ago in Rome, there was a Christian
                        doctor <span class="ln">18</span>named Valentine. According to the legend, Valentine had special
                        abilities <span class="ln">19</span>that allowed him to <em>cure</em> many diseases. However, a
                        Roman emperor <span class="ln">20</span>named Claudius did not like Valentine's Christian
                        beliefs. At that time, <span class="ln">21</span>most Romans believed in different gods and
                        goddesses. Claudius <span class="ln">22</span>said Valentine must be sent to death for his
                        unpopular Christian <span class="ln">23</span>beliefs. While he was imprisoned, Valentine became
                        friends with the <span class="ln">24</span>jailer's blind daughter and taught her special
                        abilities to cure her <span class="ln">25</span>blindness. Valentine was killed on February 14,
                        but before he died, he sent <span class="ln">26</span>a special note to the girl and signed it
                        "Your Valentine". This friendship <span class="ln">27</span>was the world's first Valentine
                        message.</p>

                    <p><span class="ln">28</span>Eventually, the Christians became more powerful in Rome. They <span
                            class="ln">29</span>wanted people to stop the festival of Lupercalia because it honoured
                        gods <span class="ln">30</span>that were not Christian. At that time, the people loved their
                        festival and <span class="ln">31</span>did not want it to end. So, the Christian leaders
                        encouraged people to <span class="ln">32</span>celebrate St. Valentine at the festival because
                        they viewed him as an <span class="ln">33</span>example of their religion. Since then, the
                        traditions of Valentine's Day have <span class="ln">34</span>changed, but the day is still seen
                        as a special time to honour the <span class="ln">35</span>celebration of love and friendship.
